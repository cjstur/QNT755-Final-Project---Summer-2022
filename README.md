Final Group Project

Project members:  Matthieu Bouteillier, Cynthia Eisnor, Michael Scarborough

Project will include analysis of data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).  The WHO was founded in 1948 with the main purpose of promoting health and keeping the world safe.  

The WHO has been collecting data on COVID-19 since December 2019.  Data includes number of cases, number of deaths as well as vaccinations administered.  Our project will answer questions like:

 - What is the death rate by country
 - What is the vaccination rate by country
 - What vaccination was used the most
